## Features

"Let's Do List!" offers a simple yet powerful task management system with three separate sections:

1. **To-Do:** Create new tasks and organize your to-do list.

2. **In Progress:** Move tasks here to indicate that you're currently working on them.

3. **Complete:** Move completed tasks to this section for a sense of accomplishment.

The standout feature is the drag-and-drop functionality that allows you to move tasks between these sections. Additionally, you can easily delete tasks by dragging them to the bin folder.

## Usage

1. Add New Tasks: Simply type your new task in the input field and click the "+" button.

2. Organize Tasks: Use drag-and-drop to move tasks between the "To-Do," "In Progress," and "Complete" sections.

3. Delete Tasks: Drag a task to the bin folder to delete it.

## Branching and Collaboration

We employed a collaborative development approach using Git branches. Here's how it worked:

1. We each worked on separate branches when implementing new features or making changes to the code.

2. After thoroughly testing and reviewing our respective branches, we pushed the changes.

3. Once we were confident in the code, we merged everything into the main branch for deployment.

## Project Planning

We found GitHub's project planning tool to be extremely valuable for staying organized and efficiently managing our tasks. It allowed us to create and assign tasks, track progress, and maintain a clear roadmap for the project.

## Documentation

You can find detailed instructions on how to use "Let's Do List!" on the project instructions page. Visit [Project Instructions](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/syllabus/foundation/testing/project/) to learn more.

## Tests

Testing played a vital role in ensuring the reliability and functionality of "Let's Do List!" We invested time in learning testing and implemented tests for each method in the project. This approach helped us identify and rectify issues and provided a level of automation in our testing process.

We are excited to share "Let's Do List!" with you, and we hope it helps streamline your task management and organization.
